# XIVComboTweaks
This is a forked version of Attick's XIVCombo plugin. There's nothing fancy here, as it's mostly just maintenance for 7.0 while Attick is busy.

I use this fork to experiment with potential additions\features for pull requests. I will occasionally rebase off of attick's repo. 

## Installation

Add ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skooz/Zookins/main/pluginmaster.json``` to your list of custom plugin repositories.
